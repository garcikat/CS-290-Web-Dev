						<h5>How-to-Guide: An API of Ice and Fire</h5>
						<h2>How the API Works</h2>
					</div><!--jumbotron-->
					
					<h3>What is an API</h3>
					<p>An <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogram <strong>I</strong>nterace is way for software
					to talk to one another within a structured format. For example, let's say an app wants the top 10
					headlines from a news webpage. Without an API, it would have to read the webapge and interpret the content.
					If the news webpage would happen to change, something that happens often, then the app would not likely find
					the information it's looking for.
					But with an API, an app can send a request to the news webapge in a certain format and it will send back a 
					structured response. The app can access the data from the webpage much more easily regardless
					how much the webpage changes.
					</P>
					<h3>Request</h3>
					<p>
						It all begins with a request. To create a request we are going to use AJAX. Here is an example of a simple request
						to the API of Ice and Fire.
						<pre>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters", false);
req.send(null);
var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
console.log(response);
						</pre>
						<br>Let's break it down.<br><br>
						<code>var req = new XMLHttpRequest();</code>&nbsp - This creates an <strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong>
						object which is responsible for creating the HTTP request and receiving the returned data.
						It's the beginning of the conversation between software.<br><br>
						
						<code>req.open("GET", "http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters", true);</code>&nbsp-
						The request object is opening a GET request to the webpage <u>http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters</u>.
						The <code>"GET"</code> argument is the type of request we are sending. It's basically used for "getting" data. Another
						type of request is a POST but it is not used with this API. 
						The last argument <code>false</code>  means that this is a synchronous request. If you want to send a asychronous request,
						replace the argrument with <code>true</code>. In all of the examples we use synchronous requests for simplicity reasons.
						But it's wise to make asynchronous requests. To learn why and how skip to the <a href="guidePage4.html">Common Problems</a>
						page.<br><br>
						
						<code>req.send(null);</code>&nbsp- Now we are sending the request to the webpage. Since this is a GET
						request, we set the parameter for the <code>send</code> function to <code>null</code>. If this were a POST request, then 
						the send function would usually take a JSON string.<br><br>						
						
						<code>var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);)</code>&nbsp- 
						Here we are taking the response text sent to us by <u>http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters</u>
						and parsing it into a readable format.<br><br>
						
						<code>console.log(response);</code>&nbsp - This logs the request to the console so that we can see 
						the response. It's a nice thing to use to make sure we are getting the information that we want, what
						keys are used and how the data is organized.<br><br>
				
						Another thing to note is that usually APIs require the use of an appid which allows the API to track who is making a request.
						But this API only allows GET requests, so it doesn't require any appid so you don't have to worry about registering for one.<br><br>					
					</p>	
					<h3>Response</h3>
					<p>
						The data that the webpage sends back is a JSON object or an array of objects. The length of the response depends on what was requested 
						and the result of the request. If you are using parameters/filters in your request, the response is always an array of Objects, 
						even if you only request a single item. To access the Objects within the array, we have to use an index. The following page shows some example and details on how to
						do this. 						
						The examples below are from the <code>console.log(response)</code>. If you are in Chrome, 
						press CNTRL-SHIFT-I or F12 to access the console and other developer tools.<br><br>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6">
								The response could be a single object array: <br><br><img src="JSONobject.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
								Or an array of multiple objects:<br><br><img src="JSONarray.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br><br>
							</div>	
						</div><!--row content-->
						<br>
						Clicking on the arrow displays all the objects within the array. Clicking on the arrow next to the indexed Objects displays
						all the data which is formatted into key: value pairs. Some of the data is a single string value like <code>born:</code>
						and others are arrays like <code>aliases:</code>. The next page will cover how to extract values within the object(s) for both
						single strings and arrays.<br><br><img src="JSONdetails.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br>
						
						But if you are using an Object ID number in the request, it will send just the JSON Object. It will not be in an array so
						indexing is not needed.<br><br>
						<img src="usingID.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br>
						Clicking on the arrows next to the Object displays the keys and values.<br><br>
						<img src="usingIDdetails.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br>
