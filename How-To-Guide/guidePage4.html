						<h2>Common Problems</h2>
					</div><!--jumbotron-->
					
					<h3>Asynchronous Requests</h3>
					<p>
						When making requests you have the option to make it snychronous or asynchronous. If you chose to send a 
						synchronous request, you may see a warning pop up in the console window like this: <br><br>
						<img src="consoleWarning.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br>
						It's a warning against making synchronous requests because it could potentially freeze the webpage as it's
						trying to load. To avoid the browser warning and create an overall better application, let's make some changes.<br><br>
						<strong>Before: Synchronous</strong>
						<pre>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?name=Arya Stark", false);
req.send(null);
var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
var aliasesList = "";
for (var i in response[0].aliases){
	aliasesList += response[0].aliases[i] + ", ";
}
document.getElementById('name').textContent = response[0].name;
document.getElementById('culture').textContent = response[0].culture;
document.getElementById('born').textContent = response[0].born;
document.getElementById('aliases').textContent = aliasesList;
						</pre><br>
						<strong>After: Asynchronous</strong><br>
						<pre>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/" + inputQuery, false);
req.addEventListener('load',function(){
	var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
	console.log(response);
	var aliasesList = "";
	for (var i in response[0].aliases){
		aliasesList += response[0].aliases[i] + ", ";
	}
	document.getElementById('name').textContent = response[0].name;
	document.getElementById('culture').textContent = response[0].culture;
	document.getElementById('born').textContent = response[0].born;
	document.getElementById('aliases').textContent = aliasesList;
});
req.send(null);
						</pre><br>
						Changes made:<br><br>
						<code>req.addEventListener('load',function()</code>&nbsp - This callback function takes two parameters: the 
						event to listen for and the function that it will call once that event happens. In the example, we
						are waiting/listening for the page to load, then we can call the function. <code>function</code>
						is defined within the <code>addEventListener</code> function. You can either do this or define the function
						beforehand. Listening for an event such <code>'load'</code> will prevent our webpage from freezing as it's 
						trying to process the request and response from the API. Everything inside the <code>function()</code>
						is nothing new except now it will only take place once the page is done loading.<br><br>
						
						<code>event.preventDefault();</code>&nbsp - The send function is now at the bottom. It sends our
						request only after we tell our program what to do once the page loads. <br><br>

					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Difference in using object IDs or Filtering in a Request</h3>
					<p>
						If you make a request using any filter/parameter like <code>http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?name=Jon Stark</code>	
						, to access all the data values in the response Object, you have to use indexing. Example: <code>response[0].culture</code>.
						This is because the response is an array of Objects. Even when the response is a single object array.<br><br>
						But if you use the object's ID number in the request like <code>http://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters/583</code>, for any category, you don't need to 
						index the object to extract the data value. Example: <code>response.culture</code>. The response is not an array.<br><br>
						So when using an filter, the response will always be an array of Objects and you need to index to extract data values.
						But if you use an ID number in the request, the response is just an Object, not an array so you don't want to index.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Data Key and Value Issues</h3>
					<p>
						While testing the API with various requests, I came across a couple of issues with the some key value pairs.
						<br><br>
						<strong>isAlive</strong>&nbsp - The documentation lists in their character table of attributes the key isAlive which
						holds a boolean value. Unfortunately, the key is not listed anywhere in the response and doesn't work as a filter for
						requests.<br><br>
						
						<strong>died=''</strong>&nbsp - This one is an interesting issue. If you want to display the death date of a character or a list
						of characters and they have a null value set for their <code>died</code> key, the response it unable to finish.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Object ID's</h3>
					<p>
						If you visit the API website you'll see that on their homepage they have a way you can test out requests. They list a few
						examples below the textbox.<br><br>
						<img src="tryRequest.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><br>
						To request a specific house, book or character you would have to enter their ID. For Jon Snow its 
						<code>characters/583</code>. The problem is there is no way to know the object's ID number. The way around this is to
						instead send a request using a filter. For Jon Snow the filter would be <code>characters?name=Jon Snow</code>. The only problem 
						with using the the name filter is that you have to make sure to spell their name correctly and that there is a space
						between their first and last name if they have one. Another problem is that there are some characters that don't have names, but they
						do have an ID. So if you want a certain character, but don't know their name, you would have to filter your request based on
						another attribute like culture, birthdate, alias or book they were featured in.<br><br>
